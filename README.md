AuthDog
==================

Server side U2F/FIDO library for Node.js. Provides functionality for registering and authenticating with U2F devices.  

Based on @jacobmarshall's fork of @emilecantin's initial [implementation](https://github.com/emilecantin/node-u2flib-server). Altered to interact with the [high level interface](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-u2f-v1.0-nfc-bt-amendment-20150514/fido-u2f-javascript-api.html#high-level-javascript-api) defined by the Fido specifications, and implemented by the [Yubico reference client api](https://demo.yubico.com/js/u2f-api.js).

Status
------

Module is a work in progress, functionally working but needs better input validation and testing.  
API is also subject to change if anything is found to be missing or better layouts become apparent.  
CLI interface is currently fairly broken.

[![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/ryankurte/authdog.svg)](https://david-dm.org/ryankurte/authdog)  

The high level interface is defined as follows:
```
interface u2f {
    void register (DOMString appId, sequence<RegisterRequest> registerRequests, sequence<RegisteredKey> registeredKeys, function(RegisterResponse or Error) callback, optional unsigned long? opt_timeoutSeconds);
    void sign (DOMString appId, DOMString challenge, sequence<RegisteredKey> registeredKeys, function(SignResponse or Error) callback, optional unsigned long? opt_timeoutSeconds);
};
```

Installation
------------

```
npm install authdog
```


Usage
-----

```
var u2f = require('authdog');
```

The u2f protocol consists of two main actions:

- Registration, in which we associate specific device(s) with a user.
- Authentication, in which we verify that the user is in possession of a previously registered device.

Each of these actions consist of two phases: challenge and response.

### Device Registration

To start device registration use:
```
// Generate a registration request
var registerRequest = u2f.startRegistration(appId, existingKeys, {requestId: N, timeoutSeconds: 100});

// Save registration request to session for later use
...

// Send registration request to client
...

```

Where existingKeys is an array of metadata ({keyHandle: ..., publicKey: ..., certificate: ...}) for keys already bound to the user account.  

This registration request object can then be used on the client with `u2f.register(req.appId, req.registerRequests, req.registeredKeys, registerCallback, req.timeoutSeconds);`. This must be stored for use when validating the client response in the next step.

To finalise device registration use:
```
  // Process registration response
  var registrationStatus = u2f.finishRegistration(registrationRequest, reqistrationResponse);

  if(typeof registrationStatus !== 'undefined') {
    // Handle registration error
    ...

  } else {
    // Save device meta structure for future authentication use
    var meta = {
      keyHandle: registrationStatus.keyHandle, 
      publicKey: registrationStatus.publicKey,
      certificate: registrationStatus.certificate
    }
    ...

  }

```

### Authentication

To start the authentication process call:
```
// Generate authentication request
var authRequest = u2f.startAuthentication(appId, existingKeys, {requestId: N, timeoutSeconds: 10});

// Save request to session for later use
...

// Send registration request to client
...

```

Where existingKeys is an array of metadata for keys already bound to the user account ({keyHandle: ..., publicKey: ..., certificate: ...}).

This registration request object can then be used on the client with `u2f.sign(req.appId, req.challenge, req.registeredKeys, signatureCallback, req.timeoutSeconds);`. This must be stored for use when validating the client authentication response in the next step.

To finalise the authentication process call:
```
// Check authentication response
var deviceAuthentication = u2f.finishAuthentication(signRequest, signResponse, deviceRegistration);
